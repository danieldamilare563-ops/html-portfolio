<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Oluwadamilare Daniel Alufah, and I’m an 18-year-old certified web developer and virtual assistant based in Nigeria. I’m passionate about building clean, responsive websites that not only look great but also offer a seamless user experience. With a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end development, I enjoy turning ideas into functional digital products. Alongside web development, I’m also a certified virtual assistant with a focus on helping businesses stay organized, efficient, and productive. My ability to balance technical skills with administrative expertise allows me to support clients in multiple ways—whether that means developing a web solution or streamlining their day-to-day operations. I’m constantly learning, growing, and seeking out new challenges that push me to become better at what I do. If you’re looking for someone driven, detail-oriented, and versatile, I’d love to connect and see how I can contribute to your next project.</p>
